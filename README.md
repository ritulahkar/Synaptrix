A fast, lightweight, and modern application launcher for Linux, built with Rust and GTK4, inspired by Synapse.

## üöÄ About

Synaptrix is a GPL3-licensed application launcher designed specifically for Linux Mint (and other Linux distributions). Born out of the need for a fast, reliable, and actively maintained launcher that captures the simplicity and efficiency of Synapse, Synaptrix leverages Rust's performance and safety combined with GTK4's modern UI toolkit to deliver a snappy user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Lightning Fast**: Built in Rust for maximum performance and minimal resource usage
- **Modern UI**: Powered by GTK4 for a contemporary and responsive interface
- **Synapse-like Interface**: Familiar workflow for users coming from Synapse
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase designed for long-term sustainability
- **Linux Mint Optimized**: Thoroughly tested and optimized for Linux Mint environments
- **Wayland & X11 Support**: Works seamlessly on both display servers
- **Configurable**: Full customization through YAML configuration file
- **Dual Operation Modes**: Choose between daemon mode (stays in memory) or normal mode (exits on close)
- **Multiple Search Types**: Applications, files, recent files, and command execution
- **Open Source**: Fully open source under GPL3 license

## üéØ Why Synaptrix?

The Linux desktop ecosystem was missing a fast, Rust-based launcher that:
- Actually works reliably
- Is actively maintained
- Provides the smooth Synapse-like experience users love
- Takes advantage of modern programming practices (Rust + GTK4)
- Offers extensive customization options

Synaptrix fills this gap by combining the best aspects of traditional launchers with modern Rust performance and GTK4's advanced UI capabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Synaptrix uses a configuration file located at `~/.config/synaptrix/settings.yaml`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created with default settings on first run.

### Sample Configuration

The configuration file is automatically created at `~/.config/synaptrix/settings.yaml` on first run with default values. You can customize it to suit your preferences:

```yaml
window:
  width: 700               # Window width in pixels
  height: 500              # Window height in pixels
  position: center         # Window position: center, top, bottom
theme:
  background_color: rgba(248, 249, 250, 0.30)  # RGBA: last value (0.30) controls transparency
  accent_color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.8)        # Color for highlights and selections
  text_color: '#2c3e50'                        # Text color in hex format
behavior:
  max_results: 50          # Maximum number of search results to display
  auto_close: true         # Close window after launching an item
  show_descriptions: true  # Show application descriptions in results
  quit_on_close: false    # Operation mode: false = daemon, true = normal
recent_files:
  enabled: true            # Enable recent files search
  max_files: 200          # Maximum files to track
  xbel_path: ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel  # Path to XBEL recent files
  directories:
  - ~/Documents           # Directories to index for file search
  - ~/Downloads
  - ~/Desktop
  - ~/Pictures
```

### Detailed Configuration Options

#### Window Configuration
- **width/height**: Set the launcher window dimensions
- **position**: Control where the window appears (`center`, `top`, `bottom`)

#### Theme Customization
- **background_color**: Window background with transparency control
  - Format: `rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)`
  - Alpha value (0.0-1.0) controls transparency: 0.0 = fully transparent, 1.0 = fully opaque
- **accent_color**: Color used for highlights, selected items, and UI accents
- **text_color**: Color for all text elements (hex format: `#RRGGBB`)

#### Behavior Settings
- **max_results**: Limit the number of search results displayed to keep the interface clean
- **auto_close**: Whether to close the launcher window after selecting an item
- **show_descriptions**: Display descriptive text for applications and files
- **quit_on_close**: Controls operation mode
  - `false`: **Daemon Mode** - App stays in memory for instant subsequent launches
  - `true`: **Normal Mode** - App completely exits when window is closed

#### File Integration
- **recent_files**: Configure recent files tracking
  - **enabled**: Turn recent files search on/off
  - **max_files**: Limit how many files to track
  - **xbel_path**: Path to the system's recent files database
- **directories**: List of directories to index for file search
  - Add any directories you frequently access
  - Supports `~` for home directory expansion
  - Subdirectories are automatically included

### Configuration Options

- **Window Settings**: Control window size, position, and appearance
- **Theme Customization**: Set colors, transparency (4th RGBA value), and visual style
- **Operation Modes**:
  - **Daemon Mode** (`quit_on_close: false`): App stays in memory for instant launches
  - **Normal Mode** (`quit_on_close: true`): App exits when window closes
- **Search Behavior**: Configure result limits, descriptions, and auto-close behavior
- **File Integration**: Enable recent files tracking and specify directories to index

### Configuration File Location

The settings file is located at: `~/.config/synaptrix/settings.yaml`

- Created automatically on first run with sensible defaults
- Fully customizable - edit with any text editor
- Changes take effect after restarting Synaptrix
- If corrupted or deleted, a new default file will be regenerated
